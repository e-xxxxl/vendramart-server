 * The only door through which a paid sub-order changes status. It:

 *   2. applies it with a guarded update (`status` must still be what we read), so two people clicking at
 *      once cannot both succeed,
 *   3. writes the log row (who, when, why), records timestamps like deliveredAt,
 *   4. returns stock and flags a refund when an admin cancels paid goods,
 *   5. tells the customer and vendor (best effort, never blocks the change).
 * Callers are responsible for checking the actor may touch THIS sub-order (own vendor, assigned handler).
